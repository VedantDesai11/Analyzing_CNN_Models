Training and analyzing different Convolution Neural Network models on CIFAR-10 Dataset and plotting their loss, accuracy, validation accuracy and validation loss using tensorboard.

Different layer sizes, number of 2D convolution layers and number of dense layers.

This shows how much better Convolution Layers are at extraction features from an image for classification.
